# PlaygroundX
Started sometime November 2022 for my grade 11 capstone project in Computer Programming 11. I have since continued to work on the site for fun whenever I found time or inspiration to make something. The website has achievements to complete and easter eggs sprinkled around.

## Games
* Number guessing game
* Rock paper scissors (against a computer)
* Tic Tac Toe, vs either a friend or a random choice generator
